## Project description

  #### Navigation bar

  The project is a webpage with many sections and a dynamic navigation bar which contains the title of each section and scrolls to that section smoothly when clicked. When the section is displayed on the screen, its title in the navigation bar is highlighted.

  #### Sections active state

  When a section is displayed on the screen, its state changes to active and its background color changes.

  #### Scroll to the top button

  The web page contains a button that's only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page and scrolls to the top of the page when clicked.

## Usage

The navigation bar and the scroll to the top button enable smooth navigation through the page.
